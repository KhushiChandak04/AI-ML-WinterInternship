# AI-ML-WinterInternship
Winter Internship 2k24 by KJSIT (Comps Dept.)
## **Project Details - Image-to-Image Translation with GANs**

### **Topic:** Image Style Transfer or Data Augmentation

- **Goal:** Train a GAN (e.g., CycleGAN, Pix2Pix) to perform image-to-image translation, such as converting day-to-night images, sketches-to-real images, or augmenting datasets with synthetic images.
- **Implementation:**
    - Use a dataset like Cityscapes for day-to-night translation or a custom dataset.
    - Train a GAN with generator-discriminator adversarial loss.
- **Learning Outcome:** Understanding GAN architectures, image synthesis, and model evaluation.
- **Stretch Goal:** Generate synthetic training data to boost performance in other tasks.
